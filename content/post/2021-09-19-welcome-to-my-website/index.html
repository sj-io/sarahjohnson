<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I built a basic working version of it within a day, and I wanted to outline the main tools I used.</p>
<p>If you have minimal coding experience like myself, the number of moving parts can get overwhelming. If I wasn’t in a field with a lot of data analysis, I would probably save my time and pay for a service like Squarespace. I previously built a blog with <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, where I paid <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/digitalocean/">$5 a month</a> for server space. It was nice to write posts on my iPad and save drafts in the cloud, but I knew I wanted to go in a different direction in the future.</p>
<p>I have found <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> to be a great tool for writing and data research, and I wanted an excuse to practice it more. To create this website I used <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, an R package that allows me to build a website within RStudio.</p>
<p>I previously used bookdown, a similar R package, to write <a href="https://github.com/sj-io/MA-capstone">my master’s capstone</a>. For that paper I kept track of citations using <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, which is <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html">seamlessly integrated</a> into RStudio. The <a href="https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/">tidycensus</a> package allowed me to quickly pull data directly from the Census Bureau, rather than using data.census.gov to download files to my computer. I created reproducible tables and graphs using R code chunks, no Excel or manual data entry needed. Other R packages like leaflet made interactive maps easy to load.</p>
<p>To get the website off the ground, I needed more than RStudio. This website’s code is stored <a href="https://github.com/sj-io/sarahjohnson">on Github</a>. I use Git to track changes and revisions to this website, all of which you can see <a href="https://github.com/sj-io/sarahjohnson/commits/main">here</a>. It is hosted for free using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. The site theme is currently the Academic theme from <a href="https://wowchemy.com/">Wowchemy</a>. I would have been very lost without <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/">this blog post by Alison Hill</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I look forward to learning how to develop and customize this website even more. Stay tuned!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Since the post was originally created, the version of blogdown mentioned has moved from development to production (and then surpassed). Under Step 3 #1, just enter <code>install.packages("blogdown")</code>, ignoring stuff about remotes.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
