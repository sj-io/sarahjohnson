Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I built a basic working version of it within a day, and I wanted to outline the main tools I used.

If you have minimal coding experience like myself, the number of moving parts can get overwhelming. If I wasn't in a field with a lot of data analysis, I would probably save my time and pay for a service like Squarespace. I previously built a blog with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), where I paid [\$5 a month](https://ghost.org/docs/install/digitalocean/) for server space. It was nice to write posts on my iPad and save drafts in the cloud, but I knew I wanted to go in a different direction in the future.

I have found [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to be a great tool for writing and data research, and I wanted an excuse to practice it more. To create this website I used [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), an R package that allows me to build a website within RStudio.

I previously used bookdown, a similar R package, to write [my master's capstone](https://github.com/sj-io/MA-capstone). For that paper I kept track of citations using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), which is [seamlessly integrated](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html) into RStudio. The [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) package allowed me to quickly pull data directly from the Census Bureau, rather than using data.census.gov to download files to my computer. I created reproducible tables and graphs using R code chunks, no Excel or manual data entry needed. Other R packages like leaflet made interactive maps easy to load.

To get the website off the ground, I needed more than RStudio. This website's code is stored [on Github](https://github.com/sj-io/sarahjohnson). I use Git to track changes and revisions to this website, all of which you can see [here](https://github.com/sj-io/sarahjohnson/commits/main). It is hosted for free using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The site theme is currently the Academic theme from [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/). I would have been very lost without [this blog post by Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/).[^1]

[^1]: Since the post was originally created, the version of blogdown mentioned has moved from development to production (and then surpassed). Under Step 3 \#1, just enter `install.packages("blogdown")`, ignoring stuff about remotes.

I look forward to learning how to develop and customize this website even more. Stay tuned!
